# ML_Materials

This materials contains some of the ML projects which are implemented practically in our real life. I have provided some code for this implementation which are explained below one by one.

## Age Estimation
In order to run age estimation project first you need to set up your age dataset and run the following python command

    python for_resnet.py
  
## Face attendance
This project is implemented to identify the people's face for the attendance system using facenet and keras. To implement this, run

      python classify.py
      
##  Sign Language Detection
This project helps to identify the hand gesture or sign language defined. It is useful for those who cannot speak properly. There are twor files inside this project. In order to train the model first, run the following command

    python sign1.py
    
For the real time detection using camera, run the command

    python opencv_sign.py
